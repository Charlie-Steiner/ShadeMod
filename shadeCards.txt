Distribution conclusions: Have plenty of 0-costs, but they're clustered at uncommon. Want more skills at common and way more attacks at uncommon. Want a few more powers (some 2 cost?).  Maybe want another X card. Need more rares and just a few less commons.

Budget: ~14 cards, mostly uncommon and rare concepts.

Cards to add:

2-cost rare power that makes zombies poison things on death. (Putrefaction)

attack that summons zombies next turn. (Pound of Flesh)

Scry attack (Doomsay)

Rare that really eats up your deck. Exhausts/wounds in exhcange for power. (Consume)

Uncommon 2-cost power that maakes skeleton attacks AOE (Coordination)

Card that exhausts cards to summon zombies and deal damage. (Attract Ghouls)

AoE attack that adds a wound to draw pile. (Reckless Swipe)

Power that makes wraiths scale as the fight goes on. (Soul Toxin)

Attack that applies debuffs and exhausts. (Asphyxiate)

New basic card. Move "claw back" to uncommon, instead we want the new basic card to be a little fiddly. Maybe draw a card, exhaust a card? (Careful Cut) And/Or maybe change basic cards by making animate dead not exhaust?

Cheap attack that scales off exhausts and synergizes with itself (by exhausting your whole hand after playing), to such a degree that it could beat the heart. (Spontaneous Ritual)
