Card Bugs+Balance:
FleshOffering should maybe put some in the discard and be less bad to reduce medkit variance.

self-burial shouldn't return statuses/curses.

Spire shield shouldn't give you -focus.

Change description on skeletons when coordination is in play.

minions Power doesn't seem to update description at all. (???) (maybe fixed by overriding stackPower and ReducePower to force description updates) (nope, still broke!)

As a card, press the attack is pretty dumb.

For now, trying out non-exhausting animate dead with unchanged Claw Back.

Make call and Touch of the grave legibly flash what card they're replaying. (maybe they need unfadeout and stopglowing on the shown card?)

General Todo:
Maybe make a special change to zombie's calculated block, or a tooltip, for speed potion, to make it clear that it won't help?

Set up keywords for zombie, skeleton, wraith?

Wraith art often doesn't "pop" (add blurry white border?)

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse.

Card art, Power art, more interesting VFX / SFX, custom heart scene.
