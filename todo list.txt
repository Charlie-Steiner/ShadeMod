Card ideas: Some card that exchanges wounds or maybe other status cards for Dazes?

De-uglify the campfire art. (done)

Note where the game slows down and either fix code or report to mod discord. (Already done for Discovery.)

UI upgrade for multiple awakens, telling you how many you have.

Add to card queue-s, like call of the grave, are currently slower than resolving all the other powers, when ideally resolving the card would happen instantly. Annoying to code, might just fix by pushing the trigger on call and touch of the grave to the bottom of the list of powers.

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse. Keep an eye out for bugs where the sacrifice cards aren't properly glowing.

Try to notice places for more interesting VFX / SFX [e.g. Dark of Night]

Sfx for summoning undead [particularly for indirect summons like pound of flesh, offering to the beyond, etc]? Wraith: champ charge up. Skeleton, Zombie: appear. (done) Need more obvious SFX for skele and zombie. How about byrd attack 2 and 1 respecively. (done)

Revisit getPortraitImageName in ShadeCharacter, delete for "production" output.
