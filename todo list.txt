Card Bugs+Balance:
Nerf wraiths to 25 damage on the assumption that you'll want a scaling rare with them?

Need to make sure that the recurring cards don't work with Apparitions.

Need a tooltip about how shade cards only get back shade cards, not statuses, curses, or colorless cards. Or need to make a keyword for this concept.

Zombies don't block MadHubris, probably would fun if they did?

Last gasp works correctly if there's only one card in exhaust, but returns the card to your draw rather than playing it if you do the card select screen. (probably fixed)

Offering To the Beyond needs a second number that counts down as you exhaust cards, a la panache. (may have found TwoAmountPower in stslib)

Should double check that call of the grave handles ravenous horde and one is enough correctly. (seems to)

Power text for awaken not changed to reflect functionality. (done)

Asphyxiate now deals accidentally damage equal to the poison stacks *before* playing the card. (probably fixed by moving poisong checking from constructor to Update method of asphyxiate action)

Spontaneous ritual does 1 too much damage? Probably counts itself as a card in hand during effect calculation. (maybe fixed)

Should also check if spontaneous ritual is affected by strength / vulnerable properly.

Trample does 0 damage? (trying manipulating baseDamage instead. Also, am I sure that ominousRitual applies strength and vulnerable correctly? The DamageAllEnemiesAction is still weird.)

OneIsEnough doesn't check for having undeads yet. (should now)

PressTheAttack needs a refresh undead power (done)

Lich form a bit too good / not interesting (trying only skeletons)

Change description on skeletons when coordination is in play.

minions Power doesn't seem to update description at all. (???) (maybe fixed by overriding stackPower and ReducePower to force description updates) (nope, still broke!)

Make call and Touch of the grave, and Last Gasp, legibly flash what card they're replaying. (maybe they need unfadeout and stopglowing on the shown card?)

General Todo:
Spire shield shouldn't give you -focus.

Maybe make a special change to zombie's calculated block, or a tooltip, for speed potion, to make it clear that it won't help?

Set up keywords for zombie, skeleton, wraith?

Wraith art often doesn't "pop" (add blurry white border?)

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse.

Card art, Power art, more interesting VFX / SFX, custom heart scene.

Revisit getPortraitImageName in ShadeCharacter, delete for "production" output.
