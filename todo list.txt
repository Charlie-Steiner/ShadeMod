Buggy cards:

Need to test wraith intangibility. (Works! Problem: Wraith still triggers even if it got killed in an attack) (Fix: put the right method into OnAttackedToChangeDamage)

Ominous ritual doesn't gain dex to block (or have block affected by frail), despite it working for the damage part. (trying removing the extra checks from use() ) (okay, now it seems like it's applying double strength?!) (try fixing by moving calls for specifically strength back to where they were)


Check that ominous ritual, extra limbs properly reset for next fight.


General Todo:
Set up keywords for zombie, skeleton, wraith.

Something broke text rendering (going to campfire? Some abuse of dev console?)

add coffin dance card.

check whether the Enum patches are actually necessary, or even if they're hurting (like the library crash bug)
