Maybe buff potion of restlessness back to 3/4.

Maybe buff specifically touch of the grave to return the cards to your discard?

Buff OneIsEnough to do something, like remove your undead and gain block, if you have undead.

Make excise draw a card. [doesn't work right now?]

Zombie block wasn't updated when I drank a dex potion and started with 0 dex. Need to patch a call in to constructor, not just updateDescription? (maybe fixed by hanging onpowerapplysubscriber. Nope.)

Check interaction between play from exhaust and cards with canUse conditions

Trample needs to update its calculated damage when drawn and on card play.

Think about adding more energy scaling?

Maybe make zombies scale with 1/2 dex rather than floor(1/2)?

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse. Keep an eye out for bugs where the sacrifice cards aren't properly glowing.

Do final recolors of card/power art.

Try to notice places for more interesting VFX / SFX

Custom heart scene.
