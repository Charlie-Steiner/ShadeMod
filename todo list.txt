Buggy cards:

minions Power doesn't seem to update description at all. (???) (maybe fixed by overriding stackPower and ReducePower to force description updates) (nope, still broke!)

Frenzy doesn't reset minions power when FrenzyDown goes away, so they can stay strong one turn too long. (added refresh to FrenzyDown)


Jason's bugs:

OrbPositions not right for Surrounded fight.

Wraiths shouldn't trigger if you have barrier. (done)

Bone shards triggered 4x even with 1 skeleton. (tried to change method of doing damage)

Strikes and defends show up in matching game? (hopefully fixed by changing getStartingCardForEvent in shadeCharacter)


Balance ideas:
Uncommonify scuttling hand to reduce kunai/shuriken stacking. (done)

Buff Coffin Dance (done by summoning zmobies)

Buff potion of restlessness, nerf flesh like oak. (check)

Fresh Bones + goes from 3 turns to 2. (done)

Buff BoneSkin (maybe make it "sacrifice up to 4(3) skeletons, gain 2(3) played armor each", or something) (card changed)

Look at Grave stillness. (nerfed block)

Reduce Skeleton Army # of skeletons, have it do some damage instead. (done)

Command Soldier + a little too extreme. (capped at 3)

Bone shards maybe too strong? (dinged by 1)

Buff Lose Control to 2 wounds? (done)

Buff Sense Prey to summon zombies? (done)

General Todo:
More 2-cost rares?

Think about changing carnophage, right now requires too much synergy. Maybe have it summon undead as well?

Need more ways to summon zombies.

Think about ways to protect zombies.

make it a little easier to exhaust your own cards.

Add a self-synergy card like claw?

Improve starting relic.

Nerf zombie strength overall, make them give block on hit rather than disappearing entirely. (done)

Look into "skeletons all attack one enemy"

Needs more help for multi-enemy fights.

Look into Spire Shield debuffing your strength.

Add rare power that causes zombies to poison things on death.

Go through attacks/powers/skills and commons/uncommons/rares to balance the #s.

If there are >10 skeletons, maybe start condensing attacks to save time.

Add helpful tooltips for undead decay, skeleton attacks, wraith intangible triggers, zombie blocking.

Make custom emptySlot orbs for the different undead?

Make call and Touch of the grave legibly flash what card they're replaying. (maybe they need unfadeout and stopglowing on the shown card?)

Set up keywords for zombie, skeleton, wraith.

Something broke text rendering (going to campfire? Some abuse of dev console? Just got it after a fight where I only played AnimateDead, ClawBack, clawed back animate dead,strike, defend, bite. Timer gone, potion names gone, names of Map, Deck, Options tooltips gone, "Add a card to your hand" text is only gone when *highlighted*, other text still there.) (possibly breaking a color. Replace calls to colors with that color.cpy() ) (tried)

Wraith art often doesn't "pop" (add blurry white border?)

Go through custom actions and double check that things that only need to happen once are given "if duration = startingDuration" handles?

Make Yorick's skull a stacking relic that summons a skeleton if n'th card played was attack, and zombie if nth card was skill? (done)

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse.

Make sacrifice cards use canUse even if they're "up to."

Card art, Power art, more interesting VFX / SFX, custom heart scene.
