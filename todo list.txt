Buggy cards:
Broke the StrongBones power update - need to put the RefreshUndeadPower action back in. (done)

Call Of The Grave+ sets a card's cost to 0 even after returning it to the deck (lasts until play). probably fix by changing how the card upgrades.

Some cards don't have the right card frame, and have "BETA" art rather than palceholder art. Known: Bonestorm, Grave Stillness, Boneskin (I think the bugginess was due to extending the wrong class. Hopefully fixed)

skeleton and zombie orb text isn't updating decay rate fast enough upon change in quantity.

minions Power doesn't seem to update description at all.

make wraith tooltip and description update with Soul Pierce


General Todo:
Set up keywords for zombie, skeleton, wraith.

Something broke text rendering (going to campfire? Some abuse of dev console?)

check whether the Enum patches are actually necessary, or even if they're hurting (like the library crash bug)

A patch that makes the intangible cards into powers rather than skills, somehow. Or just be very fastidious about only letting you get back Shade cards. Or specifically exclude them.

Wraith art often doesn't "pop" (add blurry white border?)

Go through custom events and double check that things that only need to happen once are given "if duration = startingDuration" handles.

Make Yorick's skull a stacking relic that summons a skeleton if n'th card played was attack, and zombie if nth card was skill?


Balance impressions:
Retrieving from exhaust happens slightly too often right now. (should get diluted with new cards)

Ominous ritual is too slow, needs buff (at least unupgraded)

nerf call and touch of grave (target oldest rather than random?). Maybe even make them rare, or remove the return-to-deck upgrades? Maybe hit claw back somehow too.

Also, the base deck is a little boring to play. Maybe rework claw back to be more complicated? Make Yorick's skull do something a little complicated? Maybe add a third custom card to the starter deck?

Want to mitigate RNG a little, perticularly in the exhaust synergy cards. Instead, target oldest / newest?
