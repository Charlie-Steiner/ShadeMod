Card ideas: Some card that exchanges wounds or maybe other status cards for Dazes?

Check that the Thing relic works.

Change version number everywhere and add a general art thanks.

Yorick's skull text should have capitalization and highlights. (done)

Yorick's polished skull needs nerf stat (done)

Zombie description should just say unblocked damage, not attack damage. (done)

x.x did jason change scuttling hand behavior but not its text? (reverted)

Scuttling Hand is triggered by Dazed exhausting themselves at the end of the turn. Not sure how you're activating them, but try checking the "dontTriggerOnUseCard" variable of the card being played. (checked)

If someone somehow gets prismatic shard for channeling orbs, fix it so they just instantly evoke instead, and if they would gain orb the don't, or something like that.

Custom orb system! Need to patch in rendering, probably applying focus (probably not done), clearing between combat and resetting to emptySlots (done?), and doing start and end of turn actions (done?). Need to make UndeadSpawnAction check if you're the shade and fail gracefully [text bubble] if not (done). Need to go through and change all references to orbs to undeads. Need to go back and delete the orb patch and the setting that gives Shade 3 starting orbs (done).


Having Bite as an uncommon card is a bit awkward, Achyr suggests replacing it with something else.

Try to calculate Asphyxiate damage for hovering over.

Ominous Ritual and the uncommon card with a similar effect are a bit too vague in their wording. "Deal damage for each card Exhausted this combat."
This could be: Deal ? amount of damage once for each card exhausted this combat orDeal damage based on the number of cards exhausted once
If it's a single hit with damage equal to the number of exhausted cards, I just suggest rewording it to "Deal damage equal to the number of cards Exhausted this combat." (done)

If something exhausts from the hand, you don't need to specify. Look at True Grit+ for an example of this.
This applies to Careful Cut and... some other card (done)

Self-Burial's wording is a bit poor. Suggestion:
Exhaust your hand and the top 10 cards of your draw pile. Shuffle all Unearthed cards into your draw pile and draw 3 [5] cards. Exhaust. (tried to make slight improvement)

Doomsay art needs cropping

Make campfire image a little smaller, to make room for possible extra buttons.

Note where the game slows down and either fix code or report to mod discord. (Already done for Discovery.)

UI upgrade for multiple awakens, telling you how many you have.

Exhausting isn't a keyword, so e.g. on Grey Bargain can be non-capitalized. (done)

potion of restlessness and aura of unlife descriptions aren't accurate. (changed)

Add to card queue-s, like call of the grave, are currently slower than resolving all the other powers, when ideally resolving the card would happen instantly. Annoying to code, might just fix by pushing the trigger on call and touch of the grave to the bottom of the list of powers.

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse. Keep an eye out for bugs where the sacrifice cards aren't properly glowing.

Try to notice places for more interesting VFX / SFX [e.g. Dark of Night]

Revisit getPortraitImageName in ShadeCharacter, delete for "production" output.
