Card Bugs+Balance:

OneIsEnough should still eat your energy and exhaust if played with undead. Just needs exhaust tag.

Need to make CallOfTheGrave not replay apparitions. (done)

Need a tooltip about how shade cards only get back shade cards, not statuses, curses, or colorless cards. Or need to make a keyword for this concept.

Zombies don't block MadHubris, probably would fun if they did?

Spontaneous ritual does 1 too much damage? Probably counts itself as a card in hand during effect calculation. (I think it's fixed, but need to keep an eye on this one to check for edge cases where it's broken)

SpontaneousRitual doesn't update count while in exhaust. Does OminousRitual?

Should also check if spontaneous ritual is affected by strength / vulnerable properly. Spontaneous ritual isn't affect by strength, vuln, or weak.

Trample now deals damage and scales with strength, but isn't affected by vulnerable, though is affected by weakened. (removed applypowers from card use? Not sure what's going on)

Lich form a bit too good / not interesting (trying only skeletons)

Change description on skeletons when coordination is in play.

minions Power doesn't seem to update description at all. (???) (maybe fixed by overriding stackPower and ReducePower to force description updates) (nope, still broke!) (Is this fixed or is it a charlie computer problem?)

Make call and Touch of the grave, and Last Gasp, legibly flash what card they're replaying. (maybe they need unfadeout and stopglowing on the shown card?)

Nerf wraiths on damage on the assumption that you'll want a scaling rare with them?

General Todo:
Spire shield shouldn't give you -focus.

Maybe make a special change to zombie's calculated block, or a tooltip, for speed potion, to make it clear that it won't help?

Set up keywords for zombie, skeleton, wraith?

Wraith art often doesn't "pop" (add blurry white border?)

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse.

Card art, Power art, more interesting VFX / SFX, custom heart scene.

Revisit getPortraitImageName in ShadeCharacter, delete for "production" output.
