Card Bugs+Balance:
Check that lich form doesn't crash game.

Add ExtendedDescription estimate of damage to Trample? (check that it is applied when drawn naturally)

Change description on skeletons when coordination is in play.

Make call and Touch of the grave, and Last Gasp, legibly flash what card they're replaying. (looks like copying DarkOfNight's scheme works!)

General Todo:
Spire shield shouldn't give you -focus.

Maybe make a special change to zombie's calculated block, or a tooltip, for speed potion, to make it clear that it won't help?

Wraith art often doesn't "pop" (add blurry white border?)

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse.

Card art, Power art, more interesting VFX / SFX, custom heart scene.

Revisit getPortraitImageName in ShadeCharacter, delete for "production" output.
