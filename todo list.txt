Check that the Thing relic works (in general yes). Check with self-burial (no dice). (done)

Get keywords attached to relics. (done)

Change thing art to be more brown, add sparkle to Yorick's polished skull art. (done)

Change version number everywhere and add a general art thanks. (done?)

Self-Burial's wording is a bit poor. Suggestion:
Exhaust your hand and the top 10 cards of your draw pile. Shuffle all Unearthed cards into your draw pile and draw 3 [5] cards. Exhaust. (tried to make slight improvement)

Make sacrifice cards glow if canUse. Keep an eye out for bugs where the sacrifice cards aren't properly glowing.

Try to notice places for more interesting VFX / SFX (done Dark of Night)

Note where the game slows down and either fix code or report to mod discord. (Already done for Discovery.) (First time per run you exhaust Ascender's Bane?)

Maybe try to remove loggger entries for production run, to reduce lag.

Revisit getPortraitImageName in ShadeCharacter, delete for "production" output.
